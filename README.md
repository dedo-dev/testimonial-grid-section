## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM

### What I learned

With this challenge, I learned a lot about myself. It's important that I work based on my skills without trying to developing as a middle-level or senior developer, this is only time-wasting and It makes me feel frustrated and lose confidence in myself. All experience for the next projects.

About the Challenge I renforced my skill with `CSS Grid` e with `@container queries`.

### Continued development
For the future, I would keep focus on how to work with `CSS Grid`, `Flexbox`, `Fluid typography`, `Fluid spacing` and `@properties`.
